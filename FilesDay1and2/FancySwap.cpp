// *********** The code for this goes here  ********************

// (Q2) Now write very fancy code that uses pointers swap variables around. 

// Hint: Declare three reference variables (pointers), one for each of the variables
// x, y, and temp. Next use these reference variables(pointers) to perform the swap 
// of the contents of x and y.
