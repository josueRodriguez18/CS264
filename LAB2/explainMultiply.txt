a) What does the tripleMe prototype tell the compiler about this function?
	
	The amount of parameters, parameter type, return type and name.

b) If we did not have the tripleMe prototype, what would we have to do to rearrange our code?
	
	Move the function definition above the main function so the compiler sees it before it is called.

c) Can you identify the function definition of the tripleMe function.

	The function definition is:
		int tripleMe(int x){
			int result = x*3;
			return result;
		}
		
d) What does the first line tell us about how the function tripleMe is used.

	The first line tells us that tripleMe will return an integer and takes one integer parameter.
	
e) How many times was the function tripleMe called in this program

	Twice.
